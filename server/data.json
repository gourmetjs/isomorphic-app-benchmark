    "note": "#16 Wine Spectator Top 100 of 2014\nDeep dark red color. Black core, bright red meniscus. Aromas bursts out of the glass almost in a brooding, elegant manner. Juicy red and black fruits with notes of five spice, earth, black pepper and sandalwood. On the palate fresh juicy fruits erupt and roll across the palate as only a great Barossa Shiraz can. Lovely tactile nature with grippy fine grained tannins. Palate rolls on and on with subtle chocolate and spice notes. A brilliant vintage of Barossa Shiraz yet feels moody and tightly coiled. Watch it fan out after a couple of years in bottle. This will be a classic."

The 2013 vintage is remarkably dark and full-bodied, and yet it has such gentle tannins. It is truly a pleasure to drink, especially at the price. Lots of fruit and spices here... no need to wax poetic about this one as it tastes just plain yummy."
